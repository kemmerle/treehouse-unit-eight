SQL Library Manager

Project Description:
I completed this project as a member of the Team Treehouse Apprenticeship Program (TAP--formerly known as TalentPath). Team Treehouse provided the CSS layouts; I completed the pug templates, set up the Sequelize ORM and SQLite database, and built out the Express app and routes.

For this project, I've built a Node.js website with Express and Pug to present an imaginary library catalogue. The information about the library books is contained in a SQLite database and managed with the Sequelize ORM.     

Motivation:
The purpose of the project is first to practice with data management by experimenting with SQLite and the Sequelize ORM and second to create a Node.js website and practice with the Express web server framework and the pug template engine.

Getting Started/Installation:
Once you've downloaded the repo, navigate to its root directory in the terminal. Then enter the 'npm install' command to install all dependencies. You can enter either 'node app.js' or 'npm start' to start the servers. Open your browser and navigate to: http://localhost:3000/.
